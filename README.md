# Globe with Orbit Controls
This is a globe visually similar to the GitHub globe developed using JavaScript and the three.js library. The code reads in a custom geoJSON file at runtime using the fetch API and renders
the file onto a sphere as hex polygons. The result is a globe dotted with miniature hexagons organized in a pattern that resembles the world map. The globe also has an axis tilt with an orbit
similar to the earth's.
## Orbit Controls
Viewers may rotate, zoom in, zoom out, or spin the globe by clicking and dragging their mouse, similar to the orbit controls available when using Google Earth.
